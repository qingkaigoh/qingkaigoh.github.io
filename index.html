            </p>
          <p> In attempt to establish further ties with the west and to revise unequal treaties towards them, the Japanese started to embark on missions or envoys towards the west. As the western society got to understand “Bushido” even more, how did they view it and compare it to their values such as “Chivalry” or the “Gentleman”?

                <p> The Iwakura Mission, was one of the first primary attempts for Japan to settle unequal treaties signed during the Tokugawa period and to bring back talent from abroad. The mission began in 1871 as an envoy of about a hundred individuals consisting of officials and students embarked on a twenty-two-month trip around the dominant western countries of that time including France, United States and the United Kingdom. Iwakura Tomoni was the leader of the mission and acted as the face of the newly formed Japanese Government. Although the mission could be considered as failed because the West did not acknowledge Japan as an equal counterpart, Japan was able to prove themselves as a society willing to change their traditional mindsets and a growing power. Examples of their actions include the Iwakura Women, one of the first women to study abroad outside of Japan. Furthermore, not only did many students gather ideas from around the world to bring back to Japan to further help with further modernisation, the west also got an even better understanding of the ideologies of the Japanese people. Notably the Iwakura Mission spent a prolonged amount of time in Britain which left the British with a deep impression of the Japanese officials and scholars.

                <p>
                  Taking a quote from “Bushido and the Samurai: Images in British Public Opinion, 1894-1914” by Colin Holmes and A. H. Ion, Philip Lyttleton said to Lord Milner on the sixth of may in 1904:
                </p>
                <p style = 'font-style: italic;'>
                “I shall turn Japanese, for they at least can think, and to see any Western people in a position to set the Japs diplomacy... their organization, their strategy, their devotion and self control. Above all, their national capacity self-sacrifice and their silence,…”
                </p>
                <p style = 'font-style: italic; font-size: 12px'>
                Philip Lyttleton Gell to Lord Milner, 6 May 1904, quoted Quest for National Efficiency. A Study in British Politics i899-I914 (Oxford, 1971), p.57.
                </p>
                <p>
                The question arises where it is interesting as to why the oxford university press editor would give a comment as to denounce the west and compare them inferiorly to the Japanese.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Holmes in his study of the British Opinion of Bushido and the Samurai in 1894-1914, Bushido almost grew to a worshipped status during the period. However, there are two main reasons that contributed to this growth in Bushido’s status in Britain. Firstly, not only was Japan growing exponentially by economic and military power, the British was in a period of decline with the states taking over as a leading economical power. This lead to a lot of uncertainty towards the end of the nineteenth century which steered the British to look towards other rapidly growing powers of the world and their ideologies. Secondly, this period is where Japanese writers propagated Bushido as a key ideology of Japan’s rapid success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A key voice of Japan was Nitobe Inazo, as stated above, he was the author of the book “Bushido: The Soul of Japan” which was printed in many different English versions and spread across the American and British markets. This booked open the eyes of many westerners to the idea of Bushido.  In his book, he places an incredible amount of emphasis to the ideology of Bushido towards the success of the modernisation of Japan. He argued that Bushido was the core of Japanese society and even if Samurai’s no longer had the standing that they used to have in society, they were still able to spread the core values of Bushido throughout the middle and lower levels of the society. However, the Bushido that Nitobe Inazo portrayed towards the westerners was not the strict sense of Bushido unlike that of the Samurai portrayed in Hagakure, instead it was more of good that it had brought to Japanese society. Although Oleg Benesch states in his book “Inventing the way of the Samurai” that Nitobe Inazo’s portrait of the ideology Bushido was minimally recognised in Japan as what he wrote was detached from the Japanese society and not representative of the ideology, Nitobe Inazo was very successful in convincing the British as Nitobe’s book was the only true point of contact they had with the ideology and could only choose to believe in it. Of course, Nitobe Inazo was not along in his endeavours as other authors and officials such as Y. Okakura and Baron Suematsu that published “The Risen Sun” which was another work that stressed the importance of Bushido in Japans growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the wave of Japanese propaganda hit the British, westerners who saw it as the “answer” to a declining empire started to take action. Colin Holmes and A. H. Ion mention in their work that the three main groups of people were British military writers, individuals of the Fabian party and British commentators. The military writer Repington describes bushido as 'the highest of all ancient and modern philosophy and morals” and the Fabians Official Sir Oliver Lodges describe bushido to be something higher then the medieval English psyche of “Chivalry” but a “Public Spirit” that was similar to the likes of “Christianity” that was a “divine idea of sacrifice for the salvation of the world”. The westerners worshipped Bushido greatly and maybe even more then the Japanese at that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the British worshipped Bushido and even put it beyond Chivalry, the two ideologies may not have been very different at all. In Assad Al-Saleh’s study that compares the “Tale of the Heike” to “The Knight’s Tale”, he states that both ideologies have the same roots in the sense that they all require subordination as a warrior as well as carrying a set of values and morals that would govern one’s actions. The Knight and the Samurai are surprisingly similar, for example, the Knight held land and status like that of the Samurai and carried similar morals such as honour. Therefore, it is puzzling why the British people at the time turned to Bushido instead of Chivalry when they are so similar. However, this may be because many of the British only saw the refined and packaged Bushido through the lens of Japanese authors and propagators such as Nitoba Inazo and was biased in their judgements.

                <p style="font-size:35px; text-decoration:underline; align-self: baseline;"> Bushido in China </p>
                <p>As neighbour of Japan, China has definitely had more interactions then the western part of the globe and therefore, would be an interesting country to examine regarding their views of Bushido around the Meiji period. Similar to the examination above, we will focus on the period towards the end of the 19th century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this period, The Qing dynasty just lost the first Sino-Japanese war in 1895 and was desperate to overturn their current status. According to Oleg Benesch, there were two main views of Bushido during that time, one group of scholars sent overseas to Japan to study shared the same views as the Britain’s and saw this ideology as a antidote to the current status of China. Within this group, one of the most notable examples would be Liang QiChao, he published multiple works regarding the existence of Bushido within China. This includes works such as “China’s Bushido” or “What of the Spirit of China?’. Liang Qi Chao believed that the current China was lacking in a lot of the moral values that can be learnt from Bushido and that a creation of a “spirit” like that of Bushido could smoothen out the distrust and discourse people have by bringing back the nationalism and militarism in the commoners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, Dai Ji Tao, a member of the guo min dang, singled out the Shinto religion and contrasted the militarism to that of Confucius China that is more of a peaceful country. He also pointed out that before Japan came into contact with Confucianism and “tamed” the Samurais in the Tokugawa period. Samurai’s were many times brutal and in no way carried moral values towards people that had a lower status then them. However, towards the spur of Communism in China, Dai changed his view and published a new work “RiBen Lun” or discussing Japan. In this work, it was evident that he extracted Confucius views from Bushido and tried to steer the societies attention away from communism.

                After examining British and Chinese views on Bushido, we can see that both Nitobe Inazo and Liang Qi Chao tried to refine its good values in order to use Bushido as a tool that could act as an intangible resource or support for their country. However, it seems that they are also neglecting other historical symbols of Bushido or the roots of Bushido. A good example would be Dai Ji Tao, he initially took a stance against Bushido. However, after he had needs for the ideology to use it against communism, he decided to neglect its flaws and refine it until its only left with the good moral values. Therefore, I feel that the Bushido that transnational communities got in touch with was definitely not a Bushido that was representative of its history and Japan’s Bushido domestically. Instead, it is a refined version that authors tweak to fit their needs.
